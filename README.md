Microsoft Defender Antivirus (formerly Windows Defender) is an antivirus software component of Microsoft Windows. It was first released as a downloadable free anti-spyware program for Windows XP and was shipped with Windows Vista and Windows 7. It has evolved into a full antivirus program, replacing Microsoft Security Essentials in Windows 8 or later versions.[3]

In March 2019, Microsoft announced Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac for business customers to protect their Mac[4] devices from attacks on a corporate network, and a year later, to expand protection for mobile devices, it announced Microsoft Defender ATP for Android[5] and iOS[6] devices, which incorporates Microsoft SmartScreen, a firewall, and malware scanning. The mobile version of Microsoft Defender also includes a feature to block access to corporate data if it detects a malicious app is installed.

Microsoft Defender for Individuals
Microsoft Defender for Individuals was released to the general public in June 2022 for Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS, Android, and iOS devices.[65][66] On Windows it works alongside Microsoft's first and third-party antivirus solutions, such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

Microsoft Defender for Individuals requires a Microsoft 365 personal or family license.[67]

Microsoft Defender for Individuals is a stand-alone app that adds central management with visibility of family devices, as well as Identity Theft Monitoring (in supported regions[68]) to existing anti-malware features on Windows devices. On macOS and Android, the app includes its own anti-malware protection and on Android and iOS it also includes web protection (malicious link detection).[69]

All supported platforms share a common user interface, which is also accessible from a web browser through Microsoft's My Defender portal.
